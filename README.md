# Trucker Mudgeon’s ATS and ETS2 Map

This repo is a GitHub Pages [deploy](https://truckermudgeon.github.io) of the [`maps`](https://github.com/truckermudgeon/maps) `demo` app. It's meant to serve as a simple online reference 
of the game maps in [American Truck Simulator](https://americantrucksimulator.com/) and [Euro Truck Simulator 2](https://eurotrucksimulator2.com/).

The map also includes a hacky routing demo at [`/routes`](https://truckermudgeon.github.io/routes). 
From [the forum post](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=1899929#p1899929):

> The Routes Demo is a toy page that lets you pick a starting company and an eligible ending company (based on the cargo exported from the starting
> company and the cargo imported from the ending company). The page will show a "shortest" route in red, and a "prefer smaller roads" route in green.
> Currently, the routing code doesn't take a lot of things into account, so the routes it calculates probably won't match up with what you'd see in the game.
> But it's good enough for a demo 😆
